# ViscoMet
Viscomet is a software for controlling, acquiring and plotting the data of the new portable field rotational viscometer for high-temperature melts**. It simultaneously acquires and displays the three fundamental parameters in real time to determine the viscosity of a medium: i.e. rotation speed, torque, and temperature.

The field rotational viscometer has been designed to measure the viscosity of lavas on the volcano flanks, but it could potentially also be used in various other settings such as glass industry. At one end a shear vane is immersed in the lava and at the other end, a motor rotates the shear vane. A torque sensor is placed between the two and measures the torque exerted by the molten phase on the shear vane that is proportional to viscosity. In addition, a thermocouple placed between the blades of the shear vane measures the temperature of the material. 

ViscoMet is not designed to deliver direct viscosity values, instead, it delivers the raw data of torque and rotation per minute that can then be converted by the user. Data processing has to be operated after acquisition on an independent system and following the wide-gap concentric cylinder theory of the Couette's rotating viscometer principle.
